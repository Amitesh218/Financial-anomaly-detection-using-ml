# Financial-anomaly-detection-using-ml
simple financial anomaly detection using models trained based on multiple machine learning algorithms

the project aims to showcase the usage of machine learning models for financial fraud detection, although in the current stage it is very rough and unimpressive.

## Setting up the environment
you will need docker installed,
