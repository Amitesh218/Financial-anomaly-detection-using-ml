# Financial-anomaly-detection-using-ml
Simple financial anomaly detection using models trained on multiple machine learning algorithms.

The project aims to showcase the usage of machine learning models for financial fraud detection, although in the current stage it is very rough and unimpressive.

## Setting up tools
I'll be using docker for the entire setup, to make things easier and to isolate the operation. (Also cause i didn't try anything else)

*Docker desktop*
To install docker desktop, head to [their website]([https://www.docker.com/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)) and select the appropriate version.

*Docker*
Open a terminal and enter the following command. This will only install docker and not docker desktop, which provides the gui interface. If you prefer to work with the gui, refer the previous step.
**linux**
'sudo pacman -S docker #note that you need to type the name of the package manager used by your distro'
